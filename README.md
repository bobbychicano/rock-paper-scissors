## Boulder, Tarp, Machete Web Application

Boulder, Tarp, Machete is a subtle twist on the familiar game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. The aim was to keep the essence of the game alive but add a little fun by using different objects for the available choices.

In this project I built a web application that mimics the game of rock, paper, scissors by accepting choices from the player, and using a random generated computer choice for the opponent's choice.

The game starts when the user clicks on a button on the screen to select their choice. Then, the images for the player's choice and the computer's choice are shown on screen and a score tracker is updated with a message of who won and the updated score. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game. The player can continue to play by selecting a choice on the screen again.

For the time being, this web app is meant to be accessed on a desktop computer to ensure functionality.
